## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cognitive scientist turned developer with a passion for UI/UX, research, data analysis, and data visualisation.

### Things I made and did

+ [Talks, workshops, presentations, lectures](https://github.com/Teebusch/presentations) 

+ [Research Publications](https://github.com/Teebusch/publications/) (or check out [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tobias-Busch-4))

+ My R packages [noah](https://teebusch.github.io/noah/) and [mifa](https://teebusch.github.io/mifa/) (I have also contributed a little bit to [textgRid](https://github.com/patrickreidy/textgRid) and [rlena](https://github.com/HomeBankCode/rlena))

+ I have written a few things about R and data visualisation at [tobiasbusch.xyz](https://tobiasbusch.xyz)

+ [Here's a data visualisation I made with D3.js](https://teebusch.github.io/park-vis) and [a blog post about the process](https://tobiasbusch.xyz/a-walk-in-the-park).

+ [Some data visualisations I have made with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tiobias.busch)

+ Some D3 I wrote while working through the book *D3 for the impatient* on [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@teebusch/d3-for-the-impatient)

Feel free to have a look around my GitHub repos to see other stuff I have tinkered with and projects I was involved with.
